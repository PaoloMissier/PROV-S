\section{Introduction}

	\note{4-8 pages}
	
\textbf{Goal: }we want to characterise provenance where entities are multiple data streams and activities are aggregators over the streams.

\textbf{Motivation:} Data in movement, where \textit{Velocity} is one of the well-known 4 V's of ``big data``, is gaining prominence as a prime source of data for analytics applications.

Example of relevant application: tracking flows of (personal) data from IoT devices. An increasingly pervasive form of moving data. Tracking is important because it enables forms of reward / credit by traversing back one or more derivation steps \note{see Paolo's IJDC paper on transitive credit}

The main contribution of the (short) paper is  a conceptual model to express provenance of streaming data as it goes through analytics machines (ie aggregations operators). 
Following emerging standards in functional-style stream processing, ie. Spark, we start with standard \textit{transformations} and \textit{actions} over streams, then we propose a more general pattern, that we call PROV-S, by extending PROV slightly. \\

{\textbf{Interesting points to cover:}
\begin{itemize}
\item PROV-S deals with both stateless and stateful transformations \note{this is a fairly standard distinction, which Spark streaming makes very clearly}
\item realisation: PROV-S combines PROV with a provenance template mechanism \note{cite}, where variables are bound to stream data to continuously produce provenance documents
\item aggregation is a form of data transformation that destroys data identity. what are the implications? after the transformation the data is completely new, but its lineage should contain enough info to allow for the proportion of each input stream to be calculated. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sketch for a formalisation:}
follow the transformation / action distinction from the Spark framework:
\begin{itemize}
\item transformations map RDDs (collections) to other RDDs. We cover filter, map, and ?? as exemplars
\item  actions map RDDs to non-RDD data structures. These are typically grouping followed by aggregation functions, and we illustrate that using reduce as the exemplar 
\end{itemize}
A further important distinction:  transformations can be either \textbf{stateless or stateful}.  Stateless only depend deterministically on the input stream, while stateful transformations (1) depend on internal state of the activity, and (2) may change the state. An example is a state that holds the “average daily temp”. The input is a stream of temp values through one day, the transformation filters out those that are above average by more than 2 std deviations. The surviving data points are used to update the internal daily average at the end of the day.

With these distinctions, we describe PROV-S using a progression of:
\begin{description}
\item[baseline:] non streaming cases is just a batch of data subject to a transformation or action activity. Here the input is one single entity. Nothing new here
\item[input is a a stream of data.]  Initially cover the stateless case.      Here we have a provenance patterns that repeats over time. We show:
\begin{itemize}
\item the provenance pattern instantiated on just one token, or perhaps one window, from the stream. This is extensional.  Show on one example.
\item  how the extensional graph can be generated by a combination of (1) provenance graph template and (2) template instantiation rules.
\item we describe templates using \note{Vasa’s template framework}
\item template instantiation rules capture the semantics of the transformation.
\end{itemize}

\note{show how this works for typical Spark transformations and actions, and then generalise to generic stateless activities that operate on streams.}

\textbf{Extension to stateful case}:

the interesting bit here is that the internal state is \textit{itself an entity with provenance}.

It is an entity that is /used/ by the activity every time the activity occurs (the function operates on a new input window).

Its provenance reflects its updates over time.\\

Demonstrate the combination of output provenance and state provenance using a query that shows how an output at a certain time t is described in terms of the combination of inputs up to time t and state evolution up to t.

\section{The PROV-S pattern}

\textbf{Simple cases to show the template + binding idea in action:}

Map, filter are the most common functional transformations.

Map: see Fig. \ref{fig:baseline-map}

Filter: see Fig. \ref{fig:baseline-filter}

Reduce (an action): see Fig. \ref{fig:baseline-reduce}

\textbf{Motivating scenario}. The \textit{taxi route} use case illustrates a complex black box transformation (explaining data marketplaces here may be too complex. may need to keep this abstract, but here is the figure anyways). See Fig. \ref{fig:taxi-routes-prov}

\begin{figure}

The general case for stateless black box aggregations:  see Fig. \ref{fig:black-box-aggregation-stateless}

\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{./figures/black-box-aggregation-stateless}
\caption{}
\label{fig:black-box-aggregation-stateless}
\end{figure}

This needs extending to a more stateful case: outputs depends on older inputs, and outputs may depend on different windows for different inputs: see Fig. \ref{fig:black-box-aggregation-stateful}
