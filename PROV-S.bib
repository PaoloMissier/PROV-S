abstract = {Fine-grained data provenance ensures reproducibility of results in decision making, process control and e-science applications. However, maintaining this provenance is challenging in stream data processing because of its massive storage consumption, especially with large overlapping sliding windows. In this paper, we propose an approach to infer fine-grained data provenance by using a temporal data model and coarse-grained data provenance of the processing. The approach has been evaluated on a real dataset and the result shows that our proposed inferring method provides provenance information as accurate as explicit fine-grained provenance at reduced storage consumption. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Data streams flowing from the physical environment are as unpredictable as the environment itself. Radars go down, long haul networks drop packets, and readings are corrupted on the wire. Yet the data driven scientific models and data mining algorithms do not necessarily account for the inaccuracies when assimilating the data. Low overhead provenance collection partially solves this problem. We propose a data model and collection model for near real time provenance collection. We define a system architecture for stream provenance tracking and motivate with a real-world application in meteorology forecasting. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

@article{Glavic2013,
abstract = {Managing fine-grained provenance is a critical requirement for data stream management systems (DSMS), not only to address complex applications that require diagnostic capabilities and assurance, but also for providing advanced functionality such as revision processing or query debugging. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses operator instrumentation, i.e., modifying the behavior of operators, to generate and propagate fine-grained provenance through several operators of a query network. In addition to applying this technique to compute provenance eagerly during query execution, we also study how to decouple provenance computation from query processing to reduce run-time overhead and avoid unnecessary provenance retrieval. This includes computing a concise superset of the provenance to allow lazily replaying a query network and reconstruct its provenance as well as lazy retrieval to avoid unnecessary reconstruction of provenance. We develop stream-specific compression methods to reduce the computational and storage overhead of provenance generation and retrieval. Ariadne, our provenance-aware extension of the Borealis DSMS implements these techniques. Our experiments confirm that Ariadne manages provenance with minor overhead and clearly outperforms query rewrite, the current state-of-the-art. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},
